# Mini-todo

A simple terminal-based to-do application written in Rust.

## About

**Mini-todo** is a small, experimental project created as part of my Rust learning journey.  
The main goal of this project is to practice and reinforce what I learn while exploring the Rust language.

This application is built purely for learning and experimentation purposes.  
It does not aim to solve a real-world problem or serve as a production-ready tool.

## Purpose

- Practice Rust by building a small but complete application
- Gain hands-on experience with terminal-based user interfaces
- Experiment freely without worrying about long-term stability or design constraints

## Project Status

This is a **learning and experimental project**.

- The codebase may change frequently
- Features may be added, removed, or rewritten
- Bugs and rough edges are expected

## Running the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaanboraoz/mini-todo.git
cd mini-todo
cargo run
